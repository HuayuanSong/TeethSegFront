This repository contains the code for the Streamlit app frontend for the 3D Teeth Scan Segmentation project carried out in the 10 ECTS [02830 Advanced Project in Digital Media Technology](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02830) (E23) course at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://dtu.dk/english).").<br><br>

ML backend is based on MeshSegNet architecture by [Lian et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8984309)
<br><br>
The model has been trained on intra-oral scans of both upper and lower jaws annotated, validated by professionals in the 3DTeethSeg'22 Challenge by [Ben-Hamadou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18277)
